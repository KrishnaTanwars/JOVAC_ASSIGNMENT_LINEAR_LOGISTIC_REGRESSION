# Regression Modeling: Linear & Logistic Approaches

This repository showcases two essential supervised machine learning techniques—**Linear Regression** for predicting numerical outcomes and **Logistic Regression** for solving classification problems.

## 📂 Overview of the Repository

The project is organized into the following sections:

### 1. 🏠 Linear Regression (`Linear_Regression.ipynb`)
- **Objective**: Estimate housing prices using the California Housing dataset.
- Covers model development, interpretation of coefficients, and performance evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics.

### 2. 🧬 Logistic Regression (`Logistic_Regression.ipynb`)
- **Objective**: Perform binary classification to identify cancer diagnoses from the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Focuses on model training, threshold tuning, and evaluation using Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.

### 3. 📘 Theory-Based Questions (`QA.ipynb`)
- **Objective**: Provide conceptual clarity on when and why to use linear vs. logistic regression, including assumptions and key differences.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
